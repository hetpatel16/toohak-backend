## What went well for your group this iteration?
* Meetings: Group communicated well and we showed great teamwork.
* We all helped each other when a group member has an issues.
* Meeting hosts and meeting minutes writer also did a great job on their end.

## What didn't go well for your group this iteration?
* As git is new of all, the features get complicated and takes time for us to get used to. 
* The commits and merge requests were confusing as we were expected not to merge any code that showed an error. This took time to figure out how we had to use test.failing.

## What could you do better next iteration? 
* Finish the work earlier. This would improve in future as we get more used to git and how it works.
* We are more used to commits and mergering now, hence this part should be much easier in the future.
